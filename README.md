## Sticky

A clumsy little attempt to implement VSCode's "sticky lines" feature on Sublime Text. <br>
Since there's no full webview support, and also because I'm a mess, the thing is quite workaround-y. <br>
Use at your own risk! :D

*(You can also make it full width, just add some `style="width: 2000px"` etc. to line `120` of `sticky.py`) <br>
But better don't, cause otherwise you are going to witness some teenage string concatenation phaha.*

### Hacky installation manual (for Mac):
1. Download this repo into a folder 'Sticky'
2. Go to a folder: `/Users/*COOL_PERSON*/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/`
3. Throw 'Sticky' into there
4. Open or relaunch your cute little Sublime
5. Press `command+control+l` to activate my horrible plugin
6. Stop scrolling Instagram and start scrolling your 2007 code at last
7. You also have to eat sometimes. Use paper dishes if you can't touch water

### Activation shortcut on Windows and Linux (untested though):
```
ctrl+shift+l
```

### *~ Stick to your morning routine with Sticky and it's gonna be alright! ~*
